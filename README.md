## Check RCM simulation output for completeness

Utility classes to check climate simulation output for completeness
and soundness. At the moment this is applied to the ENSEMBLES dataset,
but it should be possible to also use it for other projects, such as
CORDEX or CMIP.

Of course, only a very specific subset of file characteristics can be
evaluated. A negative check result by no means indicates that the file
or dataset is error-free!
